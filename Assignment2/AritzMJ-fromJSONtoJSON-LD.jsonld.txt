recommendations that are applicable in this area (RDF, RDF Schema, SPARQL, OWL, CSV on the Web) and
methodologies for the generation and publication of Knowledge Graphs from multiple heterogeneous data sources
and formats, using Linked Data technologies. You will also learn about how to create shared agreed vocabularies
and ontologies that can give support to Knowledge Graph generation and publication, and will understand how
these principles and approaches have been applied to several domains. You will work on a practical hands-on
exercise that will be the basis for your participation in hackatons and other similar events."

"description": "In this course we will deepen on the importance of data for an organization. In fact, the course is centered on the
process of extraction of knowledge from databases as a support for decision making.
The planning and management of a project of data science project is the main goal of this course.
Consequently the course will start with the analysis of data sources in an organization and very briefly analyzed
data base management systems. Emphasis will be put on the ethical aspects regarding data management and
knowledge extraction.
Later students will understand the data value chain and will go deep into the process of knowledge extraction. At
this stage CRISP-Dm methodology will be used.
The course will follow on the different phases of the process: i) business understanding, ii) data understanding, iii)
data preparation, iv) modeling v) evaluation and vi) deployment.
Through all the phases the main emphasis will be on students getting hands on the different steps, techniques,
algorithms and tools."

information so that good decisions can be made. The perspective is twofold, theorical and applied, covering topics
such as: exploratory data analysis, statistical summaries and graphical representations, dimensionality reduction,
regression techniques and time series analysis. There will be an emphasis on hands-on application of the theory
and methods throughout, with extensive use of R.The course is taught in three modules which are broken down in
topics below and properly referenced in the timeline."
