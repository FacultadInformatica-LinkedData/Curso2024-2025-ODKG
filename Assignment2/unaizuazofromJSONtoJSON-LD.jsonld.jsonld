You will also learn about how to create shared agreed vocabularies and ontologies that can give support to Knowledge Graph generation and publication, and will understand how these principles and approaches have been applied to several domains. You will work on a practical hands-on exercise that will be the basis for your participation in hackatons and other similar events."
