    Analysis
    Ontology
        - The domain and/or range of some property is not defined.
        - Some classes could be created to form a hierarchy of sensor types. Using the SensorType class is not a good practice.
    RDF data
        - sosa:resultTime is used incorrectly to strore values.
        - The datatype of measured values is not correct.
        - The types of sensors are duplicated in capital letters and in lowercase.
        - Some instances of schema:GeoCoordinates contain no data.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
