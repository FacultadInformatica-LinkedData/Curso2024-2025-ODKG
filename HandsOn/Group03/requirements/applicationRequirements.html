        <p>
            This web application will facilitate the filtering and available information of districts,
            making it easy for anyone to find a district based on its average price of living,
            energy efficiency, population, number of libraries and monuments and average temperature. The application will also visualize the district's population, energy efficiency, and average price of living.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Features:</h2>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Filter based on prices of living in the district, energy efficiency, population, number of libraries, number of monuments and average temperature of the district</strong>: Users can enter their preferred values for any of the mentioned criteria and get matching results of neighborhoods sorted by price (default), with the option to change the sorting.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <strong>Information</strong>: By clicking on a district, users can see all the available information about it, such as location, energy efficiency,
            population, number of libraries, number of monuments and schools in it. By clicking on the school, the user can see additional information about the school.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <strong>Visualization</strong>: Users can see maps of Madrid where population, energy efficiency, number of universities, number of libraries, number of monuments and average temperature for every district will be visualized.
