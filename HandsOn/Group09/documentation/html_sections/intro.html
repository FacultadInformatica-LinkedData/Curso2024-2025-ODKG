<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Air pollution poses significant challenges to public health and the environment, necessitating accurate and timely monitoring of air quality metrics. The proliferation of air quality sensors and monitoring stations has generated vast amounts of data, which can be leveraged for research and policy-making. This ontology is designed to standardize the representation of air quality data, encompassing key metrics and contextual information related to monitoring stations and their respective sensors. By providing a structured approach to air quality data, the ontology promotes data sharing, integration, and analysis across different platforms and applications. </p>
