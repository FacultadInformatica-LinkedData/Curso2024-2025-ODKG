<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The air quality ontology includes several core components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Air Quality Metrics:</strong> Definitions and classifications of
        various pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide
        (CO), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and benzene, toluene, and
        xylene (BTX). Each metric is associated with its concentration value,
        measurement units, and observation timestamp.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Monitoring Stations:</strong> Information about the geographical
        locations of air quality monitoring stations, including attributes such
        as latitude, longitude, altitude, and address. Each station can be
        linked to multiple sensors.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sensors:</strong> Details about the sensors deployed at each
        monitoring station, including their types, operational status, and the
        specific metrics they measure. Sensors are essential for obtaining
        accurate and real-time air quality data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Temporal Aspects:</strong> The ontology captures the temporal
        dimension of measurements, allowing for time-series analysis of air
        quality data over days, months, or years.
    </li>
</ul>
