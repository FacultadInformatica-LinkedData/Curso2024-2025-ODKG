<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    The ontology is structured using established semantic web standards,
    including
    <strong>RDF</strong> (Resource Description Framework),
    <strong>OWL</strong> (Web Ontology Language), and <strong>RDFS</strong> (RDF
    Schema).
</p>
<h3>Key Classes and Properties</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>AirQualityMetric:</strong> Represents the measured value of a
        specific pollutant.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Properties:</strong> numericValue, measurementUnit,
                resultTime.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Station:</strong> Represents the physical location of an air
        quality monitoring station.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Properties:</strong> latitude, longitude, altitude,
                address.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sensor:</strong> Represents the individual sensors deployed at a
        station.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Properties:</strong> sensorType, observes, madeBySensor.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The relationships between these entities are defined using object
    properties, facilitating queries about air quality data in relation to time,
    location, and sensor performance.
</p>
<p>
    This ontology enables users to capture, query, and analyze air quality data
    effectively, enhancing understanding of air pollution trends and
    facilitating informed decision-making.
