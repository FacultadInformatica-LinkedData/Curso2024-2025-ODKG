As can be checked through our GitHub branches, since Hands-On Assignment 2 we opted for going straight to standards. Lecturers emphasized the importance of prioritising ontologies coming from standards such as W3C (e.g., see page 39 of ODKG "Ontology development" PDF, in bold font weight), so we looked for air quality ontology standards and we found SSN (describing sensors and their observations) which in turn uses SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator). Lecturers, during ODKG lectures, told us that is was fine and even advisable for us to go for standard ontologies soon.
 
We developed our ontology for Assignment 2 following the theory and examples from https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/ thinking of mAIR as an extension/customisation of SSN/SOSA that could be reused by any open city and any app on air quality, as well as linked by any ontology working with SSN/SOSA. Seeing page 27 of ODKG "Ontology Reuse" PDF showing 2019 esair (an OEG extension of SSN/SOSA for air quality) confirmed that ours was the right choice.
