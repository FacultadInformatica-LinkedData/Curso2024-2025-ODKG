    <h1>Application Requirements for "Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Navigator"</h1>

    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>The application aims to provide citizens with a tool to locate electric vehicle charging stations in Madrid based on proximity, station capacity, and availability of specific charging connectors. Users will also be able to filter stations based on operator, power capacity, and charging type (e.g., CCS, CHAdeMO).</p>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search by Location:</strong> The user can search for charging stations near their current location or in a specific neighborhood.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter by Charging Capacity:</strong> Users can filter results by the charging power (e.g., 50 kW, 100 kW) and connector type (e.g., CCS, CHAdeMO).</li>
        <li><strong>Station Operator Filter:</strong> Users can select stations operated by a preferred operator (e.g., Repsol, Iberdrola, Endesa).</li>
        <li><strong>Detailed Information Pages:</strong> Each charging station will have its own page displaying detailed information, including the number of charging points, location, operator, and available connectors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mock-Ups</h2>
    <h3>Home Page</h3>
    <p>The home page will feature a map of Madrid with markers indicating the locations of electric vehicle charging stations. A search bar and filter options will be provided to help users refine the results.</p>

    <h3>Search Results</h3>
    <p>After performing a search, users will see a list of matching charging stations with brief descriptions, including the operator, charging power, and distance from their current location. Clicking on a station will display more detailed information.</p>

    <h3>Charging Station Detail Page</h3>
    <p>This page will show detailed information about a selected charging station, including its operator, location, number of available charging points, supported connectors, and charging power. A map with the station's location will also be displayed.</p>
