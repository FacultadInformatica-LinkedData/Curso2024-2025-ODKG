    <h1>Application Requirements for "Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Parking Navigator"</h1>

    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>The application aims to provide citizens with a tool to locate electric vehicle charging stations and nearby public parking facilities in Madrid. The search will be based on proximity, station capacity, availability of specific charging connectors, and parking options. Users will also be able to filter stations based on operator, power capacity, charging type (e.g., CCS, CHAdeMO), and the availability of parking spots near the charging stations.</p>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search by Location:</strong> The user can search for charging stations and parking facilities near their current location or in a specific neighborhood.</li>
        <li><strong>Filter by Charging Capacity:</strong> Users can filter results by the charging power (e.g., 50 kW, 100 kW), connector type (e.g., CCS, CHAdeMO), and available parking.</li>
        <li><strong>Station and Parking Filter:</strong> Users can select stations operated by a preferred operator (e.g., Repsol, Iberdrola, Endesa) and filter by parking options like the number of available spots and accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Detailed Information Pages:</strong> Each charging station and nearby parking facility will have their own pages displaying detailed information, including the number of charging points, parking spots, location, operator, available connectors, and accessibility information.</li>
    </ul>
