    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
    Ontology
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
        - The domain and/or range of some property is not defined.
    RDF data
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - You cannot define entities using a domain that is not in your control (e.g., schema.org).
        - Datatypes are missing.
        - The instances of Neighbourhood mix information of many neighbourhoods.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
