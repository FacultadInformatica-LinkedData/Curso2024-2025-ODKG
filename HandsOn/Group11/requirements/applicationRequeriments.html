        <h1>App Description</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This application is designed to facilitate the search and location of charging stations in Madrid, 
            using open data to provide information to electric vehicle users. The aim of this project is to promote the utilization of electric cars in Madrid helping drivers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Interactive Charging Station Map</strong>: An interactive map will display the location of charging stations across Madrid, 
            with markers. Users will be able to filter stations based on power levels or the company operating the station, 
            helping them quickly identify the most suitable charging points for their needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <strong>Heatmap of Charging Station Density</strong>: A heatmap will show areas of Madrid with a high concentration of charging stations, 
            making it easy to visualize which parts of the city are well-serviced and which may need more infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <strong>Distance and Accessibility Analysis</strong>: A distance analysis feature will allow users to find the nearest charging station based on their current location. 
            It will help users plan trips by ensuring that they are always within a convenient range of a charging station.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. <strong>Personalized Recommendations</strong>: Using location, power output, and company preferences, the system can offer personalized recommendations to users. 
            For example, it could suggest the closest high-power charging station or the one operated by a preferred company, making it easier to find the best option for any given situation.
        </p>

        <h2>Interface:</h2>
        <p>
            The user can search for charging stations based on various criteria, including the current location (street or neighborhood), 
            the type of charging station (fast, regular, etc.), and other specific features. The user has a map where they can find the charging 
            stations located near them.
