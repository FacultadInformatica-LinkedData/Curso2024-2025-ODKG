    Analysis
        - The resource naming strategy is not defined for individuals.
        - The resource naming strategy should use different paths for ontology resources and individuals.
    Ontology
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
        - You can directly use rdfs:label instead of creating a "name" property.
    RDF data
        - Individuals have no type.
        - Object properties have strings as object instead of instances.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
