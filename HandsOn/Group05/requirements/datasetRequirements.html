<h2> Dataset Requirements </h2>
<html> 

We consider each of the requirements below:
<br>
<b> R1: Data are in the smart city domain </b>
<br>
Our selected dataset includes data that was part of a study on the effects of traffic-induced air pollution and explores different approaches 
towards relieving traffic (as well as air pollution). This study relates to the subdomain of "smart environmental protection and smart traffic."

<br>
<b> R2: Data are available as a CSV file. </b>

<br>
There are two csv files available in <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7613527">Zenodo  </a>
<br>
<b> R3: Data have an open license so they can be published </b>

<br>
Within <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7613527">Zenodo  </a> there is a <u> Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license included </u>.

<br>
<b> R4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</b>

<br>

The data relates to four specific traffic intersections in Riverside, California USA and can be easily linked to real-world entities. 

<br>

<b> R5: Documentation exists for the data (optional). </b>

<br> 

Two .README files are provided in <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7613527">Zenodo  </a> that clearly explain each of the fields in the text files

<br>

<b> R6: Data can come from multiple data sources (optional) </b>
<br> 
Although two datasets exist (one for measuring NO2 and the other for PM 2.5 in the air), they are data that have been collected by the researchers and do not originate from another source.
