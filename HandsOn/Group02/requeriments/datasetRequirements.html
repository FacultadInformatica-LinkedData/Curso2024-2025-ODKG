        <h2>R1. Data are in one of the smart city domains.</h2>
        <p>
            A smart city uses technology and data analytics to improve city services, infrastructure, and overall quality of life. Madrid is considered a smart city.
            <br>

        </p>
        <h2>R2. Data are available as a CSV file.</h2>
        <p>
            The data is provided in .csv, .xls and JSON formats. Click on the link above to view the data.
        </p>
        <h2>R3. Data have an open license so they can be published.</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Authorization for reuse and non-exclusive transfer of intellectual property rights</strong><br><br>
            These general conditions allow the reuse of the documents and data subject to them for commercial and non-commercial purposes. 
            Reuse is understood as the use of documents held by the Madrid City Council and other agencies and entities attached to it, by 
            natural or legal persons, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that such use does not constitute a public administrative 
            activity. For example, authorized reuse includes activities such as copying, dissemination, modification, adaptation, extraction, 
            rearrangement and combination of information.

        <h2>R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).</h2>
        <p>
            Each entry contains detailed geographic information, including neighborhood and district names, 
            postal codes, and precise coordinates (latitude and longitude), allowing for straightforward 
            mapping to specific real-world places. This makes it possible to link the dataset to other 
            knowledge graphs like Wikidata or DBpedia. Some tags in the dataset such as "BARRIO" or "DISTRITO" are some features
            that can be linked to the knowledge graphs.
        </p>
        <h2>R5. Documentation exists for the data (optional).</h2>
        <p> 
            You can find a brief description of the data on the link above, at the first requirement.
        </p>
        <h2>R6. Data can come from multiple data sources (optional)</h2>
        <p>
            Given that the portal aggregates various types of urban data, 
            it is highly likely that the data could come from multiple sources,
            such as different governmental departments or IoT devices.
