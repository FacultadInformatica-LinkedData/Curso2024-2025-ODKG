    <h1>Oil Prices in Gas Stations Dataset for Spain</h1>
    
    <h2>Compliance with Requirements</h2>
    
    <p>This document describes how the dataset on oil prices in gas stations across Spain meets the specified requirements for a smart city dataset.</p>
    
    <h3>Requirement 1: Data are in one of the smart city domains</h3>
    <p>This dataset belongs to the energy and transportation domain, both of which are essential components of smart city management. Monitoring fuel prices supports smart city policies regarding energy consumption and transportation optimization.</p>
    
    <h3>Requirement 2: Data are available as a CSV file</h3>
    <p>The dataset is available as a CSV file, providing an easy-to-use format that is compatible with a variety of analytical tools and programming languages, such as Python, R, and Excel, for data processing and analysis.</p>
    
    <h3>Requirement 3: Data have an open license so they can be published</h3>
    <p>The dataset is provided under an open license, such as the Open Data Commons or Creative Commons licenses, which permits the use, redistribution, and publication of the data. This allows the data to be freely shared and incorporated into various applications and research projects.</p>
    
    <h3>Requirement 4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations)</h3>
    <p>The dataset includes geographical information (e.g., the coordinates of gas stations) and can be easily linked with locations across Spain. This allows for integration with other spatial datasets, such as traffic patterns, regional demand, or environmental factors.</p>
    
    <h3>Requirement 5: Documentation exists for the data (optional)</h3>
    <p>The dataset is accompanied by thorough documentation, which includes metadata on the variables (e.g., type of fuel, price, location), collection methodology, and update frequency. This ensures transparency and easier use of the data.</p>
    

    <h2>Application of the Dataset</h2>
    <div class="application">
        <p>An application of this dataset could be a **fuel price comparison app** that helps drivers in Spain find the most affordable fuel prices in their vicinity. The app could show an interactive map where users can view the current fuel prices at nearby gas stations, sorted by fuel type (e.g., diesel, gasoline, biofuels).</p>
        <p>Users could set alerts for price drops or receive notifications when the price at a particular station hits a certain threshold. Such an app could contribute to smarter fuel consumption decisions and increase competition among gas stations to offer better prices.</p>
