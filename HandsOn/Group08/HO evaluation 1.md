    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The resource naming strategy should use different paths for ontology resources and individuals.
    Ontology
        - The ontology presents serialization issues; is not a valid Turtle file. Do not create ontologies by hand; use some tool.
        - Check that all class names start with capital letter.
        - Check that all property names start with non-capital letter.
        - You don't need to define the owl:Class class.
        - Use meaningful labels (e.g., "c o d_ d i s").
    RDF data
        - The RDF file has not been submitted.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
