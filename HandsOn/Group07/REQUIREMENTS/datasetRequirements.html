        <li><b>R4. Linkable Entities:</b></li>
        <p>The dataset contains several entities that can be linked to external data sources:</p>
        <li><strong>Geographical Locations:</strong> Each event is associated with a specific venue, which includes geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) or an address. These can be linked to:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wikidata:</strong> Venue coordinates or names can be linked to specific locations in Madrid, such as famous landmarks, parks, or cultural venues.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenStreetMap:</strong> The venue’s location can be visualized and enhanced with detailed maps, showing the surrounding area and transportation options.</li>
        <li><strong>DBpedia/EsDBpedia:</strong> Links to regional or location-based information within Madrid, such as cultural or historical significance, can be explored through these semantic resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>Event Data:</strong> The dataset contains event-specific information like title, description, date, and time, which can be linked with other datasets to provide context and enrichment. For example:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cultural or Public Event Data:</strong> Event data can be combined with datasets containing information about festivals, exhibitions, or public holidays in Madrid to get a comprehensive view of cultural activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Ticketing or Attendance Data:</strong> Event-specific data can be linked with ticket sales or attendance records to analyze the popularity or audience size of specific events.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>Timestamps:</strong> Each event includes a start and end time, which can be linked with temporal data to analyze event participation or other patterns. For example:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weather Data:</strong> By linking timestamps with weather datasets, you can analyze how weather conditions (e.g., rain, temperature) affect event attendance or outdoor activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Transportation Schedules:</strong> Event times can be matched with public transportation datasets to study the relationship between event schedules and transportation availability (e.g., bus or metro schedules).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other datasets that contain compatible entities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tourism Data:</strong> Madrid tourism datasets (e.g., information about tourist hotspots) can be linked using geographical location and event dates to study how events influence tourism.</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic Data:</strong> Traffic flow datasets can be linked with event locations and timestamps to analyze how large gatherings affect traffic congestion or road conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Hotel and Accommodation Data:</strong> Event data can be linked to accommodation datasets to study how events impact hotel occupancy and pricing, especially for large events.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Data:</strong> By combining event data with local economic datasets (such as retail sales or hospitality performance), one can analyze the economic impact of major events on local businesses.</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
