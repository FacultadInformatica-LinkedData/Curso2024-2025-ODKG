        - xsd:text does not exist.
        - In OWL, having multiple domains (or ranges) means that the domain (or range) is the intersection of all the classes.  The current definitions of properties with multiple domains are wrong.
        - What's the meaning of the "c" property?
        - The domain and/or range of some property is not defined.
        - "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespaceid" does not exist.
