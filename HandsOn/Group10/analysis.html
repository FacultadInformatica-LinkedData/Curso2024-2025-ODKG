        <h1>Dataset Analysis</h1>
        <p>This dataset contains 6.744.091 rows of data ready to be used for analysis. It also contains 18 columns divided into categorical, numerical, datetime, text, and geolocation values that are distributed in the following way:</p>

        <h2>Datetime Columns:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>fecha, unlock_date, lock_date:</strong> These columns track the date and time of bike usage. Useful for time-based analysis. These columns do not allow null values and the dates can take values between June 01 of 2021 to February 18 of 2023.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Numerical Columns:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>idBike:</strong> Unique identifier for each bike, useful for aggregating trips by bike. It does not allow null values. These IDs range is from 0 to 8.090, but the number of unique bikes in operation in this dataset is 4.932.</li>
            <li><strong>trip_minutes:</strong> Duration of each trip, a critical metric to analyze ride times. It does not allow null or negative values, but a trip can last 0 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>station_unlock, station_lock, dock_unlock, dock_lock:</strong> These represent the IDs of the docking stations and individual docks, allowing analysis of station usage. These columns can be null when the bike was not taken or left at a station. The station IDs range is from 1 to 889, and the dock IDs range is from 1 to 30.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Geolocation Columns:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>geolocation_unlock, geolocation_lock:</strong> Contains a dictionary with location data for the unlock and lock events, considering the latitude and longitude of the geolocation point. It does not allow null values.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Text Columns:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>address_unlock, address_lock:</strong> Provides the address where the bike trip started and ended. It allows null values.</li>
            <li><strong>unlock_station_name, lock_station_name:</strong> Contains the names of the stations for the unlock and lock events, useful for station popularity analysis. These columns allow null values when the bike was not taken or left at a station.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Categorical Columns:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>fleet:</strong> Could be used to group or filter bikes based on their fleet. It does not allow null values and can take the values 1 or 2.</li>
            <li><strong>locktype, unlocktype:</strong> Can take the value "STATION" if the bike was taken or left at a station, or "FREE" if the bike was taken or left elsewhere. These columns do not allow null values.</li>
        </ul>
