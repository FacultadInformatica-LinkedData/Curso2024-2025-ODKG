    <h1>Project Title: Air Quality Visualization and Analysis</h1>
    
    <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
    <p>This project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data in Madrid by integrating various datasets and entities. 
    The primary focus is on understanding the impact of air pollution on public health and the environment through comprehensive data analysis.</p>

    <h2>Objectives:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Combine air quality data with socioeconomic, demographic, and health datasets to create a holistic view of air quality issues in different regions of Madrid.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Develop interactive graphs and visualizations that highlight key trends, patterns, and correlations in air quality data over time and across different geographic locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Impact Analysis:</strong> Explore relationships between air quality metrics and public health outcomes, such as respiratory illnesses and hospitalizations, to establish connections between pollution and health impacts.</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic and Meteorological Influence:</strong> Investigate how traffic events and meteorological conditions affect air quality levels, providing insights into potential mitigation strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather data from various sources, including the Madrid City Council, Spain's National Statistics Institute (INE), and public health databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Clean and preprocess the data for analysis, ensuring compatibility across different datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Use statistical methods and tools to analyze correlations and trends in air quality, traffic patterns, and health outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization Tools:</strong> Employ data visualization tools to create compelling visual representations of the findings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Expected Outcomes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A comprehensive dashboard displaying real-time air quality metrics and trends.</li>
        <li>Detailed reports outlining the relationship between air quality and health impacts.</li>
    </ul>
