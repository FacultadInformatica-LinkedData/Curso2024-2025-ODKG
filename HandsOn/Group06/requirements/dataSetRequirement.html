    Reuse is understood as the use of documents held by the Madrid City Council, provided that such use does not 
    constitute a public administrative activity.</p>

    <h2>Link of Entities in Our Dataset with Others</h2>
    <h3>Geographic Location</h3>
    <p><strong>Field in the dataset:</strong> Geographic coordinates or locality names.</p>
    <p><strong>Potential links:</strong> You can link the geographic location of stations with other datasets containing 
    socioeconomic or demographic data to analyze how different areas of Madrid are affected by pollution.</p>

    <h3>Additional Data Sources</h3>
    <p>Data from Spain's National Statistics Institute (INE) on demographic characteristics of Madrid (population density, 
    income, etc.). Geospatial information about land use (residential, industrial, commercial) to study patterns in urban areas.</p>

    <h4>Example of Linkage</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitoring Stations + Meteorological Conditions:</strong> Link the monitoring station with weather data from the same location to study how wind speed or humidity affects pollution levels in that area.</li>
        <li><strong>Date + Traffic Events:</strong> Analyze pollution data by days and hours and link it to traffic events in Madrid to see how pollution spikes coincide with peak traffic hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Link of Other Entities with Ours</h2>
    <h3>Public Health Data</h3>
    <p><strong>Linking entity:</strong> Geographic region (city, district) and time period.</p>
    <p><strong>Dataset examples:</strong> Hospitalization records: Government health agencies or platforms like INE (Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica)
    might provide data on hospitalization rates due to respiratory conditions. Mortality or morbidity datasets: Health organizations often publish data on respiratory diseases, which could be correlated with air quality levels.</p>

    <h4>Linkage</h4>
    <p>Linking air quality data with health outcomes such as respiratory illnesses or hospital admissions can help establish connections between poor air quality and health impacts.</p>
