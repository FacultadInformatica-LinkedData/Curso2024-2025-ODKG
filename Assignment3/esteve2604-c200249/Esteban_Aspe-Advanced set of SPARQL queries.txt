In all queries LIMIT as been introduced to reduce the answers of the query. If you want all results, please delete the LIMIT.

1. Get all the properties that can be applied to instances of the Politician class (<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>)

select ?property
where {
 ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
 ?x ?property []
} LIMIT 1000

2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class
select distinct ?property
where {
 ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
 ?x ?property [].
 FILTER (?property != rdf:type)
} LIMIT 1000

3. Which different values exist for the properties, except for rdf:type, applicable to the instances of Politician?
select distinct ?property ?value
where {
 ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
 ?x ?property ?value.
 FILTER (?property != rdf:type)
} LIMIT 1000

4. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, which different values do they take globally for all those instances?
select distinct ?property ?valuesForAll
where {
 ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
 ?x ?property ?valuesForPoliticians.
 ?y ?property ?valuesForAll.
 FILTER (?property != rdf:type)
} LIMIT 1000

5. For each of these applicable properties, except for rdf:type, how many distinct values do they take globally for all those instances?
select distinct ?valuesForAll
where {
 ?x a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician> .
 ?x ?property ?valuesForPoliticians.
 ?y ?property ?valuesForAll.
 FILTER (?property != rdf:type)
} LIMIT 1000
NOTE: To obtain the Distinct values for each property, I considered using group by to group each property with their different values, but
DBpedia informed that query would take too long.
