Here we have the same issue as in the 4th problem. Here, we just need to alter the value to instead show count of values grouped by properties. I did the exact same thing. 
This time, however, the timeout was quite adamant to not show any result. 

PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?property (COUNT(DISTINCT ?value) AS ?uniqueValues)
WHERE {
  ?politician a dbo:Politician .
  ?politician ?property ?someValue .
  FILTER(?property != rdf:type) .
  ?subject ?property ?value .
}
GROUP BY ?property
ORDER BY ?property

With the limited version for faster computing being:


PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?property (COUNT(DISTINCT ?value) AS ?uniqueValues)
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT DISTINCT ?property
    WHERE {
      ?politician a dbo:Politician .
      ?politician ?property ?someValue .
      FILTER(?property != rdf:type)
    }
    # OFFSET 1 THIS IS FOR TEST PURPOSES
    LIMIT 1 # Limiting the number of properties to query. Remove this at your peril.
  }
  ?subject ?property ?value .
}
GROUP BY ?property
LIMIT 100  # Limiting the number of values to retrieve. Remove this at your peril.
