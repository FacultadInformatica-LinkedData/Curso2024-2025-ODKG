What I understand by this query problem is what are the values these properties take when they are not necessarily associated to politicians in the entire knowledge graph.

A simplified version of this query would be:

PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?value
WHERE {
  ?politician a dbo:Politician .
  ?politician ?property ?someValue .
  FILTER(?property != rdf:type) .
  ?subject ?property ?value .
}
ORDER BY ?property


However, in the online query executor provided, this time-outs quite badly. For that, I propose a limitting of the properties chosen.

PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
SELECT DISTINCT ?property ?value
WHERE {
  {
    SELECT DISTINCT ?property
    WHERE {
      ?politician a dbo:Politician .
      ?politician ?property ?someValue .
      FILTER(?property != rdf:type)
    }
    # OFFSET 1 THIS IS FOR TEST PURPOSES
    LIMIT 10  # Limiting the number of properties to query. Remove this at your peril.
  }
  ?subject ?property ?value .
}
ORDER BY DESC(?property) 
LIMIT 100  # Limiting the number of values to retrieve.

This seems to proc the automatic estimator for query estimated time to completion > time-out, which leads to not even trying to query it. After some attempts and other services used, I managed to get the provided results.
