Ricardo Ferreiro de Aguiar; RicardoFerreiroDev; SocialLink; https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5235823; SocialLink is a Linked Open Data dataset that links Twitter accounts to entities in DBpedia, facilitating knowledge transfer between social media and the Semantic Web. So on the one hand, it supports Semantic Web practitioners in better harvesting the vast amounts of valuable, up-to-date information available in Twitter; on the other hand, it permits Social Media researchers to leverage DBpedia data when processing the noisy, semi-structured data of Twitter.
